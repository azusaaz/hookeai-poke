# Hookeai Poke
Welcome to our food ordering experience for the fictitious restaurant 'Hookeai Poke'.

Hungry clients of Hookeai Poke can visit this website, select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up. The restaurant will receive a text to start the order, which then they can text 'Confirmed' to send a message to the customer that they have received the order and it is being prepared.  When the order is ready for pick up, they can then text 'Ready', which then will notify the customer they can now go pick up the order.

This project was our first stab at a group project, brought together by: Chris Arsenault, Ivana Lee, Ryan Kendrick and Azusa Shimazaki.
